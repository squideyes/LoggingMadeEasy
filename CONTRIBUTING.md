Although **LoggingMadeEasy** is mostly a demo for the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/philly-net/" target="_blank">PhilyDotNet</a> user group, please feel free to offer up your additions and improvements; via pull-request:

* Be sure to add a standard license header  (from  **LoggingMadeEasy.sln.headertext**) to new source-code files
* No changes to the solution-wide .editorconfig file will be accepted
* Pull-requests will not be accepted without a full-coverage unit-test for new or updated functionality
 
NOTE: just to be clear, the **LoggingMadeEasy** is (very!) opinionated library.  As such, it may not be for everyone.  Even so, a close antecedent of this code has been successfully deployed in dozens of production apps and services.
